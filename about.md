My name is Shashank Barthwal, a.k.a xscorp.
I am a 22yo guy who loves learning about automation and cyber security stuff. I enjoy researching about new things, creating automated cyber security tools and conducting security research.
Currently I am a college student persuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science & Engineering with specialization in Cyber Security.
Apart from computers, I enjoy playing computer games, playing classical piano, listening to music and going for a long walk alone in my free time.
